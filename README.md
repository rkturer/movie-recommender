# movie-recommender
Project in Progress!!!

ðŸŽ¬ðŸŽ¬ðŸŽ¬ A movie recommending program ðŸŽ¬ðŸŽ¬ðŸŽ¬

**phase one**

Downloaded three data sets (movies.dat, user.dat and ratings.dat) off of Movie Lens 

Cleaned and explored the data using Jupyter Notebook 

Created a "cleaned_movies.csv" which includes MovieID, Rating (average rating for movies w/ >5 ratings), Genre, and Title

**phase two**

Created a python file to give movie recommendations

the "user_input.py" file handles user input in the terminal and returns the genre of the user's choosing

The  "recommender.py" file reads the my cleaned_movies.csv file and retrieves the highest rated movie from the genre the user chose
